# Industrial-Training-Coding

I have done my industrial training in Webskitters Academy and I  have done this project with my 4 member Team.

I have choose dataset which I have provided. This dataset has 5 rows and 785 columns. Dataset is also very good. As my project is digit recognation so i used Random Forest Classifier for better result. I got 96.3% accuracy using that algo.

I have tried to keep it very simple that way anyone can understand the process.

You can download the dataset from the zip and use it. For this i have used jupyter notebook for this.

This project is basically we have done prediction of hand written digit recognitation. In this data we have pixel values for that digit. In the data there is colomn that consists of 'data' values which is named as label. I have done feed all the pixel values in df_x part and 'lables' into df_y part. As we know x part is used to train the model and y part is used to predict. Finally we can check accuracy how much model is working.

Thanks.
